# County Economic Development Scorecard Ranking Kenyas 47 Counties

## Project Overview
This project ranks all 47 counties in Kenya based on key development indicators: healthcare, education, economy, and service delivery. The goal is to create a comprehensive, interactive county scorecard to highlight disparities and trends.

## Key Indicators
### Healthcare
- Health facilities per capita
- Immunization coverage
- Maternal & child health statistics
- Health workforce density

### Education
- Literacy rates
- School enrollment (primary & secondary)
- Pupil–teacher ratio
- KCSE performance averages

### Economy
- County GDP / economic output
- Employment rates
- Household income levels
- Poverty index

### Service Delivery
- Access to clean water
- Infrastructure quality (roads, electricity)
- Public service efficiency metrics
- Budget absorption rates

## Data Sources
- Kenya Open Data Portal
- World Bank Kenya County Indicators
- KNBS reports
- County Integrated Development Plans (CIDPs)
- Ministry of Health, Education, and Economy datasets
- Healthcare Access: Download Kenya Master Health Facility List (KMHFL) from https://kmhfl.health.go.ke/ or KNBS County Statistical Abstracts (CSAs) from https://www.knbs.or.ke/county-statistical-abstracts/. Metrics: facilities per 100k population, hospitals/wards per county.​

Education: Fetch KNBS school census data (e.g., https://www.knbs.or.ke/reports_category/county-statistical-abstracts/) or statskenya.co.ke datasets. Metrics: primary/secondary schools per capita, enrollment rates, pupil-teacher ratios by county.​

Economy: Use KNBS Gross County Product (GCP) tables from https://www.knbs.or.ke/gross-county-product/ or Wikipedia KNBS-derived rankings (2022/2023 data). Metrics: GCP (KSh billions), GDP per capita, growth rates.​

Service Delivery: Extract from KNBS CSAs (all 47 counties available as PDFs with tables on water access, roads km/capita, electricity coverage). Metrics: % households with piped water, road density, sanitation coverage.​

## Skills Demonstrated
1. Data Engineering / Pipelines: ETL, cleaning, merging, automation
2. Scoring Model: Weighted composite indices, standardization, ranking
3. Data Visualization: Interactive dashboards, heatmaps, trend analysis
Based on the 2024/2025 Infotrak Research / CountyTrak Performance Index, the following counties stand out:

Additionally, when looking at broader development measures such as human development index (HDI), Nairobi County leads overall, followed by Mombasa County, Nyeri, Kiambu County, etc.
